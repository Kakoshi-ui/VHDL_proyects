2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U1/clk25_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1/clk25_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell U1/clk25_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/clr_mult_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/clr_mult_reg_i_2/O, cell U11/clr_mult_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/go_mult_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/go_mult_reg_i_1/O, cell U11/go_mult_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/ld_x_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/ld_x_reg_i_2/O, cell U11/ld_x_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell U11/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/x_sel_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/x_sel_reg/L3_2/O, cell U11/x_sel_reg/L3_2 (in U11/x_sel_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
