2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
17 out of 17 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: AN[3:0], A_TO_G[6:0], CLK, CLR, GO, X[2:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
17 out of 17 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: AN[3:0], A_TO_G[6:0], CLK, CLR, GO, X[2:0].
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-7#1 Warning
CONFIG_VOLTAGE with Config Bank VCCO  
The CONFIG_MODE property of current_design specifies a configuration mode (SPIx4) that uses pins in bank 14.  I/O standards used in this bank have a voltage requirement of 1.80.  However, the CONFIG_VOLTAGE for current_design is set to 3.3. If you're using any config pins in this bank, ensure that your configuration voltage is compatible with the I/O standards in banks used by your configuration mode.  Refer to device configuration user guide for more information.    Pins used by config mode: D18 (IO_L1P_T0_D00_MOSI_14), D19 (IO_L1N_T0_D01_DIN_14), G18 (IO_L2P_T0_D02_14), F18 (IO_L2N_T0_D03_14), E18 (IO_L3P_T0_DQS_PUDC_B_14), and K19 (IO_L6P_T0_FCS_B_14)

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell U11/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/clr_mult_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/clr_mult_reg_i_2/O, cell U11/clr_mult_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/go_mult_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/go_mult_reg/L3_2/O, cell U11/go_mult_reg/L3_2 (in U11/go_mult_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/ld_x_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/ld_x_reg_i_2/O, cell U11/ld_x_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/x_sel_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/x_sel_reg/L3_2/O, cell U11/x_sel_reg/L3_2 (in U11/x_sel_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U11/x_sel_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U11/x_sel_reg_i_1/O, cell U11/x_sel_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
